# Engineering Project

Students will work on an individual project of a complex nature in order to develop a solution to an engineering problem. In addition to the technical engineering development work, the project may require consideration of issues such as customer specifications, cost analysis, IP and product testing and delivery. Students will be required to give an oral and a poster presentation as well as a final report on their project.

### Course content

ENGR 489 consists of an individual project which is done under the supervision of one (or more) of our academic staff or an academic and industry supervisor. The aim is to let the student show-case all of the skills they have learnt during their BE degree. In particular, they will design, implement and evaluate a solution to a complex engineering problem. They will also present your solution through a final report, an oral presentation and where appropriate, a practical demonstration.
 
### Course learning objectives

Students who pass this course will be able to:
1. Design, implement and evaluate a solution to an appropriate engineering problem. This should demonstrate an understanding of the various trade-offs involved, provide documented evidence justifying those design decisions made and demonstrate technical leadership through innovation.
2. Justify the quality of your solution through effective written and oral communication, and through practical demonstration. Quality issues include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate technology; application of appropriate engineering and professional practices; consideration of real-world issues, such as scalability, reliability, safety and sustainability (where appropriate). 
4. Assemble evidence from a range of sources to compare and analyse the relationship between your solution to the engineering problem and that of similar systems and/or approaches. Sources include, but are not limited to, books and academic papers.
